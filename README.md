# Blink Sensor With Sigmoid Function
A simple Arduino project made more complicated! Has the rate which two LEDs flash depending on the environment, uses the Sigmoid function.

## Sigmoid Function
The sigmoid function is a bounded, real function. Its bounded by two horizontal asymptotes as x approaches positive and negative infinity. Graphically, the function produces an "S"-shaped curve.

The function is represented by the formula:

  S(x) = 1/(1+e^(-x))
